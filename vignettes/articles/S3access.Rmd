## Overview

When FaaSr functions execute in the cloud, they start from a blank slate - they don't have file inputs available. 
Furthermore, when they finish execution, outputs are not automatically saved - it's your responsibility to save any output that should persist.
This is because FaaS platforms are *stateless* - i.e., no persistent *state* (e.g. files) is available/saved unless you explicitly do so.
Hence, typically FaaSr functions follow this pattern:

- Files are stored persistently in an S3 *bucket*
- The *names* of folder(s), file input(s) and output(s) in that bucket are passed as arguments to the function
- At beginning of execution, the function *gets* all the inputs from the S3 to a local folder
- During the execution, the function creates in a local folder all of its outputs
- At the end of execution, the function *puts* all the outputs it needs to save from the local folder to the S3 bucket

## Getting/putting files from/to S3

The simplest way to get/put files from/to S3 is to use the `faasr_get_file()` and `faasr_put_file()` functions. 
These examples come from the [companion vignette for single function](singlefunction.html) and [companion vignette for simple workflow](twofunctionworkflow.html):

- `faasr_get_file(remote_folder=folder, remote_file=input1, local_file="input1.csv")`
  - gets from S3 a remote file whose name is passed as function argument `input1` and which is stored in `folder` (also passed as an argument)
  - saves this file locally with name `input1.csv`
- `faasr_put_file(local_file="df1.csv", remote_folder=folder, remote_file=output1)`
  - puts to S3 a local file whose name is `df1.csv`, storing with the name gives from function argument `output1` stored in `folder` (also passed as an argument)

## Using Arrow and S3

[Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) allows efficient columnar data access for large datasets.
FaaSr provides a function `faasr_arrow_s3_bucket()` that returns an Arrow object that can then be used in your code.
For example, the `compute_sum` function described in the [companion vignette for simple workflow](twofunctionworkflow.html) can be re-written to use Arrow as follows:

```r
library(arrow)

compute_sum_arrow <- function(folder, input1, input2, output) {

  # Download two input files from bucket, generate a sum of their contents, and write back to bucket

  # The function uses the default S3 bucket name, configured in the FaaSr JSON 
  # folder: name of the folder where the inputs and outputs reside
  # input1, input2: names of the input files
  # output: name of the output file
  
  # The bucket is configured in the JSON payload as My_S3_Bucket
  # In this demo code, all inputs/outputs are in the same S3 folder, which is also configured by the user

  # Set up s3 bucket using arrow
  s3 <- faasr_arrow_s3_bucket()

  # Get file from s3 bucket using arrow
  frame_input1 <- arrow::read_csv_arrow(s3$path(file.path(folder, input1)))
  frame_input2 <- arrow::read_csv_arrow(s3$path(file.path(folder, input2)))
  
  # This demo function computes output <- input1 + input2 and stores the output back into S3
  # First, read the local inputs, compute the sum
  #
  frame_output <- frame_input1 + frame_input2

  # Upload the output file to S3 bucket using arrow
  arrow::write_csv_arrow(frame_output, s3$path(file.path(folder, output)))

  # Print a log message
  # 
  log_msg <- paste0('Function compute_sum finished; output written to ', folder, '/', output, ' in default S3 bucket')
  faasr_log(log_msg)
}	
```
