## Desktop-side FaaSr Functions 

These are the FaaSr functions that users invoke interactively in their desktop client, e.g. RStudio. 
They are used to configure, register, and invoke workflows.

### faasr

Usage: `faasr(json_path, env_path)`

`json_path` is a required argument and specifies the path of a FaaSr workflow configuration file
`env_path` is optional and specifies the path of a file containing credentials for use by FaaSr

This is the first function used to validate and configure a workflow.
It loads the JSON-formatted workflow configuration file from the path specified by `json_path` and (optionally( credentials from a file path `env_path`. 
It returns a list that is subsequently used to register and invoke the workflow with functions `list$register_workflow` and `list$invoke_workflow`

Example: 

```r
mylist <- faasr(json_path="workflow_file.json", env_path="credentials_file")
```

In the example above, the `faasr` function configures a workflow described in the `workflow_file.json` file and loads FaaS and S3 credentials from `credentials_file`.
If successful, the function returns the `mylist` list

### register_workflow

Usage: `$register_workflow()`

This function registers a workflow with FaaS cloud provider(s). 
It requires a valid list returned from a previous execution of `faasr()` 
The cloud providers are specified in `ComputeServers` and `DataStores` of the JSON file provided as input for `faasr()`.
Their respective credentials are specified in the credentials file also provided as input for `faasr()`.

Example: 

```r
mylist <- faasr(json_path="workflow_file.json", env_path="credentials_file")
mylist$register_workflow()
```

In the example above, the `mylist` list returned from the `faasr()` function is used to register a workflow

### invoke_workflow

Usage: `$invoke_workflow()`

This function immediately invokes a workflow that has been registered with a FaaS cloud provider. 
It requires a valid list returned from a previous execution of `faasr()` that has been registered with cloud providers using `$rergister_workflow()`

Example:

```r
mylist <- faasr(json_path="workflow_file.json", env_path="credentials_file")
mylist$register_workflow()
mylist$invoke_workflow()
```


### set_workflow_timer

Usage: `$set_workflow_timer(cron)`

This function sets up a timer to invoke a workflow that has been registered with a FaaS cloud provider. 
It requires a valid list returned from a previous execution of `faasr()` that has been registered with cloud providers using `$rergister_workflow()`
The required argument `cron` is a string that [follows the cron format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron)

Example: 

```r
mylist <- faasr(json_path="workflow_file.json", env_path="credentials_file")
mylist$register_workflow()
mylist$set_workflow_timer("*/10 * * * *")
```

### unset_workflow_timer

Usage: `$unset_workflow_timer(cron)`

This function unsets a timer previously set with `$set_workflow_timer`. 
It requires a valid list returned from a previous execution of `faasr()` that has been registered with cloud providers using `$rergister_workflow()`

Example:

```r
mylist <- faasr(json_path="workflow_file.json", env_path="credentials_file")
mylist$register_workflow()
mylist$set_workflow_timer("*/10 * * * *")
mylist$unset_workflow_timer()
```

## Cloud-side FaaSr functions

These are the FaaSr functions that users add to their R functions. 
They are used to read and write from/to S3 buckets and to generate logs for debugging.

### faasr_get_file

Usage: `faasr_get_file(server_name, remote_folder, remote_file, local_folder, local_file)`

This function gets (i.e. downloads) a file from an S3 bucket to be used by the FaaSr function.

`server_name` is a string with name of the S3 bucket to use; it must match a name declared in the workflow configuration JSON file.
This is an optional argument; if not provided, the default S3 server specified as `DefaultDataStore` in the workflow configuration JSON file is used.

`remote_folder` is string with the name of the remote folder where the file is to be downloaded from. This is an optional argument that defaults to `""`

`remote_file` is a string with the name for the file to be downloaded from the S3 bucket. This is a required argument.

`local_folder` is a string with the name of the local folder where the file to be downloaded is stored. This is an optional argument that defaults to `"."`

`local_file` is a string with the name for the file downloaded from the S3 bucket. This is a required argument.

Examples:

```r
faasr_get_file(remote_folder="myfolder", remote_file="myinput1.csv", local_file="input1.csv")
faasr_get_file(server_name="My_Minio_Bucket", remote_file="myinput2.csv", local_file="input2.csv")
```

### faasr_put_file

Usage: `faasr_put_file(server_name, local_folder, local_file, remote_folder, remote_file)`

This function puts (i.e. uploads) a file from the local FaaSr function to an S3 bucket.

`server_name` is a string with name of the S3 bucket to use; it must match a name declared in the workflow configuration JSON file.
This is an optional argument; if not provided, the default S3 server specified as `DefaultDataStore` in the workflow configuration JSON file is used.

`local_folder` is a string with the name of the local folder where the file to be uploaded is stored. This is an optional argument that defaults to `"."`

`local_file` is a string with the name for the file to be uploaded to the S3 bucket. This is a required argument.

`remote_folder` is string with the name of the remote folder where the file is to be uploaded to. This is an optional argument that defaults to `""`

`remote_file` is a string with the name for the file to be uploaded to the S3 bucket. This is a required argument.


Examples:

```r
faasr_put_file(local_file="output.csv", remote_folder="myfolder", remote_file="myoutput.csv")
faasr_get_file(server_name="My_Minio_Bucket", local_file="output.csv", remote_file="myoutput.csv")
```

### faasr_get_folder_list

Usage: `folderlist <- faasr_get_folder_list(server_name, faasr_prefix)`

This function returns a list with the contents of a folder in the S3 bucket. 

`server_name` is a string with name of the S3 bucket to use; it must match a name declared in the workflow configuration JSON file.
This is an optional argument; if not provided, the default S3 server specified as `DefaultDataStore` in the workflow configuration JSON file is used.

`faasr_prefix` is a string with the prefix of the folder in the S3 bucket. This is an optional argument that defaults to `""`

Examples:

```r
mylist1 <- faasr_get_folder_list(server_name="My_Minio_Bucket", faasr_prefix="myfolder")
mylist2 <- faasr_get_folder_list(server_name="My_Minio_Bucket", faasr_prefix="myfolder/mysubfolder")
```

### faasr_delete_file

Usage: `faasr_delete_file(server_name, remote_folder, remote_file)`

This function deletes a file from the S3 bucket.

`server_name` is a string with name of the S3 bucket to use; it must match a name declared in the workflow configuration JSON file.
This is an optional argument; if not provided, the default S3 server specified as `DefaultDataStore` in the workflow configuration JSON file is used.

`remote_folder` is string with the name of the remote folder where the file is to be deleted from. This is an optional argument that defaults to `""`

`remote_file` is a string with the name for the file to be deleted from the S3 bucket. This is a required argument.

Examples:

```r
faasr_delete_file(remote_folder="myfolder", remote_file="myoutput.csv")
faasr_delete_file(server_name="My_Minio_Bucket", remote_file="myoutput.csv")
```

### faasr_arrow_s3_bucket

Usage: `faasr_arrow_s3_bucket(server_name, faasr_prefix)`

This function configures an S3 bucket to use with Apache Arrow.

`server_name` is a string with name of the S3 bucket to use; it must match a name declared in the workflow configuration JSON file.
This is an optional argument; if not provided, the default S3 server specified as `DefaultDataStore` in the workflow configuration JSON file is used.

`faasr_prefix` is a string with the prefix of the folder in the S3 bucket. This is an optional argument that defaults to `""`

It returns a list that is subsequently used with the Arrow package.

Examples:

```r
mys3 <- faasr_arrow_s3_bucket()
myothers3 <- faasr_arrow_s3_bucket(server_name="My_Minio_Bucket", faasr_prefix="myfolder")
frame_input1 <- arrow::read_csv_arrow(mys3$path(file.path(folder, input1)))
frame_input2 <- arrow::read_csv_arrow(mys3$path(file.path(folder, input2)))
arrow::write_csv_arrow(frame_output, mys3$path(file.path(folder, output)))
```

### faasr_log

Usage: `faasr_log(log_message)`

This function writes a log message to a file in the S3 bucket, to help with debugging.
The default S3 server for logs is `DefaultDataStore` as specified in the workflow configuration JSON file.
This default can be overridden with `LoggingDataStore` in  the workflow configuration JSON file.

`log_message` is a string with the message to be logged.

Example:

```r
log_msg <- paste0('Function compute_sum finished; output written to ', folder, '/', output, ' in default S3 bucket')
faasr_log(log_msg)
```

## File formats 

### JSON configuration file

The workflow JSON configuration file is [described by the FaaSr JSON schema](https://github.com/FaaSr/FaaSr-package/blob/main/schema/FaaSr.schema.json).

A recommended way to create and manage JSON configuration files is to use the [FaaSr workflow builder](https://faasr.shinyapps.io/faasr-json-builder/) Shiny app

### Credentials file

The credentials file used by FaaSr has key-value string pairs, stored one per line in a text file, with format:

`"key":"value"`

The key is the name of the credential (which must match the name of the cloud server in a configuration file)
The value is the credential itself

Example:
```
"My_GitHub_Account_TOKEN"="REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN"
"My_Minio_Bucket_ACCESS_KEY"="REPLACE_WITH_ACCESS_KEY"
"My_Minio_Bucket_SECRET_KEY"="REPLACE_WITH_SECRET_KEY"
"My_OW_Account_API_KEY"="REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_OPENWHISK_ID:SECRET_KEY"
"My_Lambda_Account_ACCESS_KEY"="REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_AWS_LAMBDA_ACCESS_KEY"
"My_Lambda_Account_SECRET_KEY"="REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_AWS_LAMBDA_SECRET_KEY"
```

The example shows credentials for the following accounts:

* A GitHub token for FaaS ComputeServer `My_GitHub_Account`
* Access and secret keys for S3 DataStore `My_Minio_Bucket`
* API key for FaaS OpenWhisk account `My_OW_Account`
* Access and secret keys for FaaS Amazon Lambda account `My_Lambda_Account`
