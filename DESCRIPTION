Description: Allows users to create and deploy the workflow with multiple functions
    in Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) cloud computing platforms.
    The 'FaaSr' package makes it simpler for R developers to use FaaS platforms by providing the following functionality:
    1) Parsing and validating a JSON-based payload compliant to 'FaaSr' schema supporting multiple FaaS platforms
    2) Invoking user functions written in R in a Docker container (derived from rocker), using a list generated from
       the parser as argument
    3) Downloading/uploading of files from/to S3 buckets using simple primitives
    4) Logging to files in S3 buckets
    5) Triggering downstream actions supporting multiple FaaS platforms
    6) Generating FaaS-specific API calls to simplify the registering of a user's workflow with a FaaS platform
    Supported FaaS platforms:
    Apache OpenWhisk <https://openwhisk.apache.org/>
    GitHub Actions <https://github.com/features/actions>
    Amazon Web Services (AWS) Lambda <https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/>
    Supported cloud data storage for persistent storage:
    Amazon Web Services (AWS) Simple Storage Service (S3) <https://aws.amazon.com/s3/>.
