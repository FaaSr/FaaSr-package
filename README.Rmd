# FaaSr

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of FaaSr is to make it easy for developers to create R functions and workflows that can run in the cloud, on-demand, based on triggers - such as timers, or repository commits. It is built for Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) cloud computing, and supports both widely-used commercial (GitHub Actions, AWS Lambda, IBM Cloud) and open-source platforms (OpenWhisk). It is also built for cloud storage, and supports the S3 standard also widely used in commercial (AWS S3), open-source (Minio) and research platforms (Open Storage Network). With FaaSr, you can focus on developing the R functions, and leave dealing with the idiosyncrasies of different FaaS platforms and their APIs to the FaaSr package.

FaaSr allows you to:
* Develop one or more *functions* natively in R in your own GitHub repository
* Deploy *actions* that invoke your *functions* in Docker containers
* Compose *workflows* consisting of multiple *actions* in a pre-determined order, described by a Directed Acyclic Graph (*DAG*)
* Register your *workflows* for cloud-native execution in one of the supported FaaS providers
* Invoke your *workflows* with *events*, including scheduled timers
* Use S3-based *cloud storage* to provide file inputs and outputs to each *action* in the *workflow*

## Usage

The functions exposed by FaaSr can be broadly divided as follows:
* Server-side functions: are executed automatically in the cloud, by your functions/workflows. These deal with moving data from/to S3 storage and logging 
* Client-side functions: are executed interactively by you, in your local desktop. These deal with registering and invoking your workflows for execution in your FaaS provider of choice

### Server-side FaaSr functions
* `faasr_get_file(server_name, remote_folder, remote_file, local_folder, local_file)` downloads a file from an S3 server to be used by an *action*
* `faasr_put_file(server_name, remote_folder, remote_file, local_folder, local_file)` uploads a file from an *action* to an S3 server
* `faasr_delete_file(server_name, remote_folder, remote_file)` deletes a file from an S3 server
* `faasr_arrow_s3_bucket(server_name)` returns an arrow object for use with S3 server
* `faasr_log(message)` adds a message to the log of the running action

### Client-side FaaSr functions
* `workflow <- faasr(configuration_file, credentials_file)` returns a *workflow* list associated with a workflow configuration file (in JSON format) and file with credentials for S3 and FaaS server(s)
* `workflow$register_workflow()` registers a *workflow* with the configured FaaS provider
* `workflow$invoke_workflow()` immediately invokes a *workflow* with the configured FaaS provider
* `workflow$set_workflow_timer(cron_string)` set a timer (using the standard CRON format) to invoke a *workflow* at a given time interval with the configured FaaS provider
* `workflow$unset_workflow_timer()` unset a timer previously defined with `set_workflow_timer()`

### Workflow configuration

Workflows are configured using the JSON file format and the [FaaSr configuration schema](https://github.com/FaaSr/FaaSr-package/blob/main/schema/FaaSr.schema.json). 

You may use the [FaaSr-JSON-Builder Shiny app](https://faasr.shinyapps.io/faasr-json-builder/) to create and edit workflows using a graphical user interface (GUI) rather than a text editor. This GUI can be used to create FaaSr-compliant JSON files from scratch (or starting from an exiting configuration you can upload using the tool). The generated configuration can be downloaded to your computer.

### Cloud credential configuration

The client-side FaaSr functions expect both a JSON configuration file describing a workflow, and an environment variable file storing the credentials for your FaaS cloud platforms of choice. The example below shows a template for S3 cloud storage, GitHub Actions, OpenWhisk and AWS Lambda credentials:

`"My_GitHub_Account_TOKEN"="REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN"`
`"My_Minio_Bucket_ACCESS_KEY"="REPLACE_WITH_S3_ACCESS_KEY"`
`"My_Minio_Bucket_SECRET_KEY"="REPLACE_WITH_S3_SECRET_KEY"`
`"My_OW_Account_API_KEY"="REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_OPENWHISK_ID:SECRET_KEY"`
`"My_Lambda_Account_ACCESS_KEY"="REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_AWS_LAMBDA_ACCESS_KEY"`
`"My_Lambda_Account_SECRET_KEY"="REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_AWS_LAMBDA_SECRET_KEY"`

## Installation

You can install the development version of FaaSr from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("FaaSr/FaaSr-package")
```


## Example

Please refer to the [FaaSr tutorial](https://github.com/FaaSr/FaaSr-tutorial) for a detailed step-by-step example that you can run on your own desktop (using Rocker) or on Posit Cloud, using just a GitHub account and the free-for-testing Minio S3 Play server
